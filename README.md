- **Natural Language Understanding**:
  - Contextual analysis of business discussions
  - Theme extraction and categorization
  - Multi-segment business analysis
  - Trend identification across quarters

### Pattern Recognition System
- **Metric Extraction Engine**:
  - Financial figures (revenue, profit, EPS)
  - Growth rates and comparisons
  - Market share statistics
  - Performance indicators

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Keyword-based sentiment scoring
  - Category-specific sentiment tracking
  - Overall tone assessment
  - Temporal sentiment changes

### Data Processing
- **Document Handling**:
